React notes

- Behind the scenes it calls: ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))
- Code within curly braces is treated as Javascript: {'Some code here'}
- Babel is a transpiler to convert JSX to Javascript
- Nested JSX must always return a single element
- Comments in code {/* Comment here */}
- ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode), where the first argument is the React element or component that you want to render, and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.
- One key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word class to define HTML classes. This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses className
- In fact, the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase. For example, a click event in JSX is onClick, instead of onclick. Likewise, onchange becomes onChange
